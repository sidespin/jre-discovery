# JRE Discovery

This feature allows the automatic discovery of managed Java Runtime Environments in Eclipse. 
It currently detects JREs managed by :
- [SDKMan](https://sdkman.io/), 
- [asdf-java](https://github.com/halcyon/asdf-java), 
- [Jabba](https://github.com/shyiko/jabba) 
- [JBang](https://www.jbang.dev/)

It also detects JREs installed on platform-specific locations:
- `/usr/lib/jvm` on Linux
- `%PROGRAMFILES%\Eclipse Adoptium` on Windows

Managed JREs will be automatically discovered on Eclipse startup, or, while running, when added by their respective Java managers.
